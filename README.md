# PyWebBrowserApp open source project

The goal of this project is to allow for the fast creation of attractive, dynamic, and responsive Desktop apps, by leveraging the power of Python (and the access to all of the many powerful Python libraries that are available) under the hood, and, at the same time, by taking advantage of the wealth of open source web-front-end libraries (CSS & JavaScript frameworks and toolkits) to deliver GUIs through a Chromium-based browser (e.g. Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, etc.).

A strong secondary goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-work-with framework/library that has a very small number of dependencies, and that is simple to set up and use.

All you need is Python 2.7.x or 3.x.x and a Chromium-based browser installed. You will also need to install the **`jinja2`** Python package into your install of Python.


## Highlights

* Very minimal dependency on non-built-in Python packages (only requires the `jinja2` Python package)
* Supported for Python 2.7 and Python 3.x
* Tested in Python 2.7.18 and Python 3.8.2 (and only tested on Windows 10 so far)

## Requirements

* Python 2.7 or Python 3.x
* A Chromium-based web browser installed
* jinja2 python package installed to Python installation

## Background

This project is a rebirth of the `ChromeAppGui` project, and has many significant improvements over its predecessor.  There is a lot more functionality provided and much of how a developer would use this project has been significantly streamlined, making it much easier to build a Desktop app with.

The main impetus for starting a brand new project for this code base is the desire to rename it so that it didn't use a specific browser name in any of its naming of packages, modules, and core classes and objects.
